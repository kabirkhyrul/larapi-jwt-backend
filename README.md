## WHAT IS JSON WEB TOKEN?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA.

Letâ€™s explain some concepts of this definition further.

### Compact
    Because of its size, it can be sent through an URL, POST parameter, or inside an HTTP header. Additionally, due to its size its transmission is fast.
### Self-contained
    The payload contains all the required information about the user, to avoid querying the database more than once.

JWTs consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which are:

- Header
- Payload
- Signature

Therefore, a JWT typically looks like the following.

`
 xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz
`
